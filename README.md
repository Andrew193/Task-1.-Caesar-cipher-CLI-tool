# Caesar cipher CLI tool

**Implement CLI tool that will encode and decode a text by [Caesar cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher)**.

The Caesar cipher or shift cipher is a symmetric mono-alphabetic encryption algorithm, in which each plaintext letter is replaced by the one that is removed from it in the alphabet by a constant number of positions. The Roman emperor Julius Caesar used a shift cipher with a key 3 for private correspondence - he substituted D for the letter A, E for B, and so on.

CLI tool should accept 4 options (short alias and full name):

1.  **-s, --shift**: a shift
2.  **-i, --input**: an input file
3.  **-o, --output**: an output file
4.  **-a, --action**: an action encode/decode
